<h1>My College Experience</h1>
<h2> <i> <p style="color:dodgerblue">Novali Guillen</i></p>
<p>So far my college experience is what I kind of expected. I expected the large work load and independance it came with it so nothing has really surprised me so far. Everything has been mundane and I don't mind it since I'm not really into drama either and I like to keep my peace. Though I didn't expect the amount of group work I'd be doing. I thought it was something I'd leave in highschool, but what opened my eyes more was the various different people I'd work with. I knew people were different, but most of the people I've worked with have been a real piece of work. Compared to other people I've worked with everyone had pulled their weight and support the group, but the people here act like it's their first time talking to people. I understand that people are shy becuase I'm also super shy, but I try to forget about that and focus on what needs to get done. I don't mind if they're shy but it really puts down everyone else in the group and I just wish people were more considerate about that. </p>
<p>Aside from my experience in college, I really want to work as a childern's book illustrator. At first, I didn't even think about doing this as a potential career. I always wanted to do something in art, but who really inspired me to do this was my highschool art teacher. During my senior year in highschool, the art classes were preparing for an art show when she came up and asked me about what I was going to do for college. I told her I wanted to do something with art but I wasn't sure where in the field I wanted to work in and she gave me the idea to be a childern's book illustrator. She said that my work and my style would be really good for that type of career. The more I thought about it, the more I wanted to persue it so I have her to thank for helping me figure out what I want to do.  </p>
<p> <br> Though this isn't considered a ethical value, this quote is a value I live by. This quote is from a movie called <i>Call Me By Your Name.</i> It's a queer romance movie, and during the beginning the mother of the main character was reading out loud to her son (the main character) the line <q> Is is better to speak or to die?</q> came out and became a famous line from the movie though it holds a lot of meaning. It highights two choices between speaking and dying. Speaking meaning that you choose to be vulnerable and taking that risk to speak whats on your mind. On the other hand, to die meaning you choose living in regret and not taking that risk of saying what you wanted to say. This line meant a lot to me and it taught me to be confident and take risk. We only live once, and not taking those risk could mean your losing an opportunity meant for you. I want to make sure I live my life taking every chance and every risk because I don't want to miss anything meant for me.</p>
<p> Something I really enjoy doing is collecting trinkets. There was a French T.V. show called <i>Gaspard and Lisa.</i> They used to sell a bunch of little knickknacks and trinkets but because the show is over they dont make them anymore so it's hard to find things that are within reasonable prices. Though I was really lucky to find a plush keychain made by the show for a really good price!</p>
